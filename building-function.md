# Building the Function application

We will start by building the Function application and test it. 

## Creating the Function application

Follow these steps to create the Function application which will contain the Saver and the Getter functions.

1. In Visual Studio 2017, select File, New, Project.
2. Under Cloud, select Azure Functions.

3. Enter the name of the project you want to create (for instance: LbCoinValue).

> Note: The Lb stands for my name, Laurent Bugnion. I use this to make the Azure Function name unique in a given subscription, for example when this subscription is shared with other co-workers. Of course you can use a different naming scheme to make your function's name unique, if necessary.

4. Select the location for the new project and press OK.

5. In the New Template dialog, 

In the next steps, we will [create the Coin Value Saver](TODO) (Timer Triggered Function).
