# Building the Function application

We will start by building the Function application and test it. 

* [Creating and testing an HTTP triggered function](TODO)
* [Creating and testing a Timer triggered function](TODO)
* [Creating a trial account and a storage account in Azure](TODO)
* [Publishing an Azure Function to Azure from Visual Studio](TODO)

## Creating the Function application

Follow these steps to create the Function application which will contain the API endpoints.

1. In Visual Studio, select File, New, Project.
2. Enter the name of the project you want to create (for instance: LbCoinValue).

> Note: The Lb stands for my name, Laurent Bugnion. I use this to make the Azure Function name unique in a given subscription, for example when this subscription is shared with other co-workers. Of course you can use a different naming scheme to make your function's name unique, if necessary.

In the next steps, we will [create the Coin Value Saver](TODO) (Timer Triggered Function).
