# Xamarin and Azure Function Sample: Coin Value

This sample shows two Azure Functions:

- A Timer Triggered function used to save bitcoin value every hour to an Azure Table
- Am HTTP Triggered function used to get the current bitcoin value as well as the current trend (up, flat, down) calculated over the last 10 samples.

In addition you will find a Xamarin application for Android and for Windows Universal (UWP) connecting to the HTTP Triggered function and displaying the result.

In order to execute this sample, you need to deploy it to Azure. If you don't have a free trial account yet, [you can follow the steps here to create one](trial-account.md).
